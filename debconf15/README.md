# DebConf15: hLinux: HP's Debian Derivative a Year Later

## Background
The following is my presentation markdown of the talk I gave at DebConf15 conference in Heidelberg,
Germany, Monday, August 17, 2015. A [video replay](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2015/debconf15/hLinux_HPs_Debian_derivative_a_year_later.webm) is available as well.

I also took part in a Debian Derivatives panel discussion on
Thursday, August 20, 2015 that [video replay](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2015/debconf15/Debian_derivatives_panel.webm) is available.

## Generating Slides
This was my first time writing and using markdown to generate a presentation. I believe I used the following to generate the final presentation:
```shell
pandoc -t beamer src/DebConf15_powersj.md -o out/DebConf15_powersj.pdf -V color-theme=rose
```
